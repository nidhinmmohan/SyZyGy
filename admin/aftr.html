                <p> There are two options everyone prefer after completing B.Tech   degree(i.e. Engineering). If you are economically efficient and don't   need a job, it is better you go for your further studies. A   specialization will always earn you more salary as well as priority   during interviews and of course sound grip over subject. Otherwise if   the scenario is opposite, like you hay to pay Education Loan or Family   Responsibilty, then you can find some job either On-Campus or   Off-Campus.</p> 
              
                  <h3 style="color:#0099ff"><blockquote>Further Studies</blockquote></h3>
             
              <p>If you prefer to continue to studies, you can do Post   Graduate courses and then obtain a Ph.D. You have lots of options during   this P.G course like M.S/ M.Tech, IAS/IPS, Navy/NDA and Finance related   courses like MBA.</p>

                     <p style="color:#0099ff">GATE</p> Conducted by one of seven Indian Institutes   of Technology in rotation, Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE)   is an annual exam for admission to M.Tech and M.S. programmes in most   engineering institutes in India[citation needed]. It is regarded as a   benchmark test for engineering graduates in India [citation needed].   This examination is coordinated by a committee, comprising of Indian   Institute of Science, Bangalore and seven Indian Institutes of   Technology on behalf of the National Coordinating Board - GATE,   Department of Education, and Government of India. The pattern and   syllabus are usually based on a candidate's B.Tech. Or BE syllabus.   Minimum eligibility for appearing in this exam is usually a B.Tech, BE,   B. Arch. or Masc. The exam is usually conducted on second Sunday of   February.</p>
                  <p>If you prefer doing P.G in your field of study, you can go for   M.S/M.Tech. If you are ready to go outside India and financially sound   you can prefer M.S. You need to appear for GRE/TOEFL for doing M.S in   Foreign countries.</p>
                    <p style="color:#0099ff">GRE</p> The Graduate Record Examination or GRE is a   standardized test that is an admissions requirement for many graduate   schools in English speaking countries. It is created and administered by   the Educational Testing Service and is similar in format and content to   the SAT. It is a computer based Online Test. The percentile scored in   this exam will decide your future in doing M.S in foreign nations.</p>
                  <p style="color:#0099ff">TOEFL</p> The Test of English as a Foreign Language (or   TOEFLÂ®, pronounced &quot;toe-full&quot; or sometimes &quot;toffle&quot;) evaluates the   potential success of an individual to use and understand Standard   American English at a college level. It is required for non-native   applicants at many English-speaking colleges and universities. A TOEFL   score is valid for two years and then is deleted from the official   database.</p>
                  <p><em>It is not worthy for anyone doing P.G in some college other than   Foreign/Indian University Colleges, and Premiere Private Engineering   Colleges.</em></p>
                  <p style="color:#0099ff">MBA</p>
                  <p>If you prefer doing P.G in some finance related courses you can definitely go for MBA.</p>
                  <p style="color:#0099ff">GMAT</p> The Graduate Management Admissions Test,   better known by the acronym GMAT (pronounced G-mat), is a standardized   test for determining aptitude to succeed academically in graduate   business studies. The GMAT is used as one of the selection criteria by   most respected business schools globally, most commonly for admission   into an MBA program.</p>

               <p>This is the most preferred route by engineering students in education after B.Tech.</p>
                  <p style="color:#0099ff">Software industry</p> <p> What ever the branch you are in   during your engineering you can get into a software industry with   simply communication skills. It is good if you get a job during the   campus placements itself because it is really difficult to find a job   after you come out of the college. However there are various kinds of   jobs in Software industry which you get accordingly as your course of   study or your specialization. It is ok if you do job for sometime and   start studying again for your P.G courses.</p>
                  <p style="color:#0099ff">Indian Civil Service</p><p> Even though corporate jobs   may offer the best of salaries and perks, a majority of youngsters and   their parents still crave entry to the prestigious Indian Civil Services   held by the UPSC. The very fact that a big share of every year's top   posts in the civil services exams are bagged by professionals from   various streams, shows that the IAS is still the dream job for many</p>
